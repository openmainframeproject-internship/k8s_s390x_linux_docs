# LinuxOne_Kubernetes_Canonical_Deployment_Documentation
This work, which is a part of [Open Mainframe Summer Internship](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/projects/internship-program) 2018 covers the instructions to setup a Kubernetes Cluster on Canonical Ubuntu 18.04, on LinuxOne Servers.

The documentation is written in [asciidoc](http://asciidoctor.org/) & is rendered using Github Pages over [here](https://openmainframeproject.github.io/LinuxOne_Kubernetes_Canonical_Deployment_Documentation/index.html).

I have also made a video demonstrating the whole setup. The link to the same can be found [here](https://youtu.be/Ae8ptEXaM-8).
